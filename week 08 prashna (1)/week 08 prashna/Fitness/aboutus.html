          <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
          <p>
            The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to
            do as part of their daily exercise routine.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Burpee</dt>
            <dd>
              Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength
              and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and
              extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward
              again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
            </dd>
            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>
              Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a
              push-up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the
              position as long as you can.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>
              Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on
              the floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest,
              and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing
              a mountain).
